# HostelGate
The new website for HostelGate

I was assigned to develop the new website for HostelGate. This is one of my first front-end projects and i really enjoy it.

I will be using all the latest technologies for a responsive web design:

• Bootstrap
• HTML5
• CSS3
• Javascript
• JQuery

Work is still in progress and this is not the final design as the client may request changes in the meantime.
Nevertheless is a good example of my ongoing work.
